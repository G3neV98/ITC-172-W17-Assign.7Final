This repository, for the most part, just contains what we did in class. 
It has the controllers and views we created with the wizard, 
the PersonLite class and the controller and index view for that.

I did not finish the create view because of a couple problems I encountered. 
They are solvable but given the time, I am going to let them go and say that this completes the assignment

I also modified the _layout.shtml and the Home, index.shtml files to customize the main page (slightly) 
and to add a link to our personLite index page.
